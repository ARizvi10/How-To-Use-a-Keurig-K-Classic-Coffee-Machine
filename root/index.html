    <p>For individuals who have just purchased or have begun using a Keurig K-Classic coffee machine, you might be confused as to how to properly utilize this machine. Using an instant coffee machine can save a lot of time in the morning and money compared to purchasing from a cafe. This set of instructions will show how to work a single-serve coffee machine.
    <h2>
        Tools and Materials:
        </h2>
    <p>To begin using a Keurig K-Classic Coffee Machine you will need:
        <ul><li>An Keurig K-Classic coffee machine</li> 
        <li>A Keurig or K-Cup pod, purchasable at most grocery stores</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>A mug or cup for your beverage</li>
    </ul>

   <em><strong>Warning: </strong>Coffee dispensing from the machine is between 195 and 205 degrees fahrenheit and hot enough to cause third degree burns.</em> 
    </p>
    <h2>Instructions: </h2>
    <ol>
       <li>Be sure the coffee machine is plugged into the wall.</li> 
    <li>Open the water chamber and fill it with between 6 to 10 ounces of water and then close.</li>
       <li>Open the slot for the Keurig Pods and place one in and then close.</li> 
        <li>Place a cup or mug underneath the area where the pod went.</li>
        <li>Power on the machine and let it run until it stops making a rumbling sound. This allows it to draw in and heat the water.</li>
        <li>When the buttons start glowing, select the desired amount of coffee you wish to make.</li>
        <li>Wait as the beverage is brewed.</li>
        <li>It is done when no more of the coffee is pouring out of the machine.</li>
        <li>Add cream and sugar if desired. Enjoy your coffee.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Troubleshooting:</h2>
    <ul>
       <li>If the machine heats the water but is not brewing the beverage, try adding more water to the water chamber. The issue can be due to not enough water being present.</li> 
        <li>Make sure the machine is properly plugged into the wall and powered on.</li>
        <li>If coffee is pouring out of the mug, try picking a button corresponding to a lesser amount.</li>
    </ul>
